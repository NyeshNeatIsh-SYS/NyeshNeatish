sg ships int if you want.

PS;you can go see my kin list (if you want before commenting too.(for understanding me better ig?)

-Also,DNGTC means 'do not get too close' !
 
_pfp by me

I do use tonetags,but only with people I'm comfortable or close with.im a bit clingy and can be jealous too:But when it's about other friends I'um chill about it. any joke comment like 'you act like a baby' or wtv,I might believe it so DONT push me down the cliff.

if you're Amelia,dni,you discomfort me and always will.6t

IF YOU CAN'T STAND 18+ STUFF DO *NOT* INT.(it's not because I'm being rude, it's for your safety and you might get uncomfortable,i bring that type of topic in random times.)
