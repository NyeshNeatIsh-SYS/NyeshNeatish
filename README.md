• ×` I also have ADHD and autism/But my autism 'level' is not that high, so MAYBE there is no way to notice, I am also very sensitive + I don't take jokes or pranks seriously,so don't go too hard on me. ^w^ _%·* 🐛

• >∆_ I can be a little schizophrenic, and no, don't worry if I'm away for a long time or if I'm talking more 'depressed' than usual, I'm just a little calm and need some time to 'enjoy myself' sometimes- 💨

- MORE INFO ↓ ↓ -

  "If I don't go after you (if you're a friend or someone I know), it's because I want to be alone, sometimes this happens when I'm listening to music (or painting) or maybe I just don't want to talk."

 "I don't talk much, I'm a little shy when I talk to people (anyone, even those I know), so when you see that I'm talking a lot (which is probably about strange things), it means: Craziness, probably something abt my adhd or smt like that idk lol..."

  "I usually stay in trees and also hide in them (in pt), each place I stay has a meaning, you might learn a little about me, I really like explaining things and talking. ^_^"

- IMPORTANT ↓ ↓ -

 "I don't like when people ask me about my real life or my parents (I've had daddy issues AND mommy issues since I was 6 years old),You can ask me all you want about my appearance, and if you see that I'm talking a little about my life to you, it's because I trust you. (remember that) ;))"
