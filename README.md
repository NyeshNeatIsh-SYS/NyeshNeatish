(19+ PPL DO **NOT** INT.....) // only some of my friends or people I know !
-
I don't use discord. try talking to me on pt or twitter at least.

INNTTT PLSS and C+h too!! <33 ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹

sg ships int if you want. (Specially gi-hun x recruiter or Hwang X Recruiter!)// (I don't ship Hwang X gi-hun, everytime I try to ship them it makes me weird, they're more into a 'platonic-brothers' relationship..but if you ship them,you can still int!)

PS;I don't use 'Kys/kms,sexual' jokes and usually hate dark humour. the only thing i joke about is gore jokes and humour. ^_^

-Also,DNGTC means 'do not get too close' !
 
_pfp by me

I do use tonetags,but only with people I'm comfortable or close with.im a bit clingy and can be jealous too:But when it's about other friends I'm chill about it. any joke comment like 'you act like a baby' or wtv,I might believe it so DONT push me down the cliff.

add:if you're Amelia,dni,you discomfort me and always will.

IF YOU CAN'T STAND 18+ STUFF DO *NOT* INT.(it's not because I'm being rude, it's for your safety and you might get uncomfortable,i bring that type of topic in random times.)

PLEASE. i beg you...tell me when something is making your uncomfortable,and I'll stop it.seriously...

i can be energetic when I'm around ppl i like/p,or family members like online brother,sis or partner,but I'm only a little bit more different when it's about my silly kids ^w^.
